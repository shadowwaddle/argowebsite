### April Team Meetings Recap: Progress and New Initiatives

**April has been a dynamic month for our team, characterized by a mix of technical learning, application preparation, and continued development of our online courses. Here’s an overview of our achievements and the collaborative efforts that drove us forward.**

#### Hack+ and AI Exploration: Meeting 10

On April 7th, our team convened with attendees Preston, Jeeva, Natalie, Alex, Ben, Sharvil, Sean, and Danielle. The agenda focused on the second Hack+ application, AI, and computer architecture, as well as finishing up the slides for our projects. A key task was to recruit new members to expand our team. We made progress on the Hack+ application and continued our technical discussions.

#### Workish Day: Meeting 11

Our eleventh meeting took place on April 16th with a smaller group—Preston, Alva, and Ben. This session was less formal, focusing on completing ongoing tasks, particularly the online course. A notable moment was Alva's playful transformation into a kite runner, adding a light-hearted touch to the day's efforts.

#### CAD Learning: Meeting 12

On April 17th, Preston, Jeeva, Sharvil, Sean, Danielle, and Annika gathered to focus on learning CAD (Computer-Aided Design). The primary goal was to finalize the slides for our online course. Despite a minor setback with a failed AC installation, the team remained focused on mastering CAD skills, essential for our future projects.

#### Course Development and Fundraising: Meeting 13

Our final meeting of the month was on April 28th, attended by Preston, Jeeva, Natalie, Alex, Ben, Danielle, and Annika. The agenda included getting participants into the WAAW online course Discord, assigning online course homework, learning how to use Onshape, watching FTC videos, and planning fundraising activities. One idea was to fundraise with See’s Candy, a popular local option.

In a lighter moment, we had an unexpected incident with the cats escaping from the room and jumping downstairs, adding a bit of excitement to our productive session.

### Looking Ahead

April has been a month of significant learning and steady progress. From exploring advanced AI concepts to refining our CAD skills and preparing for the Hack+ application, we have continued to build on our foundation. The development of our online courses and fundraising efforts are set to propel us further in the coming months.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to advance our goals and make strides towards our mission!
