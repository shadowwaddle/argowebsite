### Argo rest month

#### Vacation!

In June, the members of Argo took a month break to relax, recouperate, and enjoy their summers! 

We continued to teach our online course with the WAAW foundation, finishing the Artifical Intelligence chapter. 

#### First Bake Sale

We aditionally held our first bake sale to raise money! We held a stand outside at the front yard of Sean's house. We sold cookies, bubble tea, brownies, and a Japanese snack called Onigiri. We were very succesful and raised over $400!

#### Ordered parts for our chassis

Our hardware team worked hard to research and CAD our first iteration of our chassis for the 2024-2025 season! We ordered our parts and are working on assembling the chassis next month!
