### August Team Meetings Recap: Building Our Robot and Beyond

**August has been a busy month for Argo Robotics, focusing on robot construction, WAAW certificates, and planning our next workshops. Here’s a summary of our achievements and teamwork.**

#### Certificates and Construction: Meeting 22

In mid-August, the team gathered with Preston, Jeeva, Sean, and Alex in attendance. The focus was split between finishing the WAAW foundation certificates and building the robot chassis.

Preston completed the WAAW course certificates with Alex and sent them to the students. Later, he helped Jeeva build the chassis. Jeeva worked on building the chassis and organizing small parts. Sean assisted with the chassis construction, encountering some challenges related to screws and part placement, while Alex finalized the WAAW certificates and supported the chassis build.

The agenda for this meeting focused on finishing the WAAW foundation certificates, building the robot chassis, and organizing hardware parts. By the end of the session, the robot chassis was completed, screws and other hardware were organized, and the certificates were sent to WAAW course students.

#### Improvements and Research: Meeting 23

A week later, the team reconvened to continue improving the robot’s chassis and researching additional components.

Preston looked for specific spacers but was unable to find them. He later updated the website with the chassis CAD. Jeeva improved the chassis with Danielle, and together they researched options for control hubs and expansion hubs. Sean assisted with the chassis improvements. Alex worked on documentation and continued supporting Jeeva, while Danielle helped with research and planning future modifications for the robot. Seraj updated the outreach journal with information on the WAAW course and researched vlog topics for upcoming STEM content.

The agenda involved improving the robot’s chassis, finding necessary spacers, and planning purchases from Rev Robotics. By the end of the meeting, significant progress was made in upgrading the chassis and updating the team website.

#### Workshop Planning and Sponsorships: Meeting 24

Toward the end of the month, the team focused on planning the next workshop and pursuing sponsorships.

Preston worked on a sponsorship application for Rev Robotics and updated the outreach journal. Jeeva assisted Natalie in planning the next workshop. Sean helped plan the new workshop, which will focus on building catapults, while Natalie reached out to secure another workshop location. Danielle helped brainstorm workshop ideas with the team, including a catapult challenge, and Ben worked on tracking the status of grant applications. Alex focused on learning new software for robot programming.

The agenda for this meeting centered on planning the new workshop and researching sponsorship opportunities and grants. Progress was made on both fronts, with the workshop plan taking shape and sponsorship applications advancing.

### Looking Ahead

August was a month of hands-on construction and forward planning. We made excellent progress with our robot and workshops while securing important sponsorships and partnerships. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue building toward our goals!
