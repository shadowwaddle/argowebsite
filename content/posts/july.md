### July Team Meetings Recap: Building Momentum and Planning for Workshops

**July was an exciting month for Argo Robotics, as we continued to work on our robot, fundraisers, and outreach initiatives. Here’s a summary of what we accomplished.**

#### Workshop Planning and CAD Progress: Meeting 19

At the beginning of July, the team gathered to focus on uploading WAAW videos, retaking inventory, and finalizing the CAD for the chassis. Preston completed uploading a WAAW course video to Canvas and helped Jeeva with inventory. Jeeva worked on inventory management and spent the rest of the meeting CADing the chassis for the robot. Sean assisted with inventory and provided help to Jeeva on OnShape, while Alex worked on grading for WAAW and supported Jeeva’s inventory efforts. Meanwhile, Alva planned workshops and future fundraisers, and Natalie finalized the Marble Mastermind Workshop plan.

The meeting agenda covered finalizing the Gobilda order, planning the in-person workshop, and completing WAAW uploads. By the end of the meeting, the team had completed the chassis CAD, continued workshop planning, and even took a break to play some games.

#### Documentation and Fundraising: Meeting 20

The next week, the team focused on organizing outreach documentation and fundraising efforts. Preston created documentation pages for outreach projects, including a timeline for WAAW and the TLP workshop. Jeeva worked on finalizing parts orders and finances, while Sean created a Google Sheet to track team finances and helped with future fundraising plans. Alex began making the WAAW certificates, and Alva brainstormed fundraising events and merchandise ideas. Seraj introduced the concept of weekly informative articles about engineering, robotics, and technology and worked on updating the Outreach Journal with Preston’s help. AJ contributed to merchandise planning.

The agenda focused on introducing a new documentation strategy, working on outreach documentation, and managing finances. The meeting was productive, with everyone making substantial progress on their tasks.

#### Marble Mastermind and Grant Applications: Meeting 21

In late July, the team turned their attention to preparing for the Marble Mastermind Workshop and applying for grants. Jeeva worked on Google Slides for the workshop and explained FTC grant applications to Ben. Sean assisted with the workshop slides and helped build a demo for the kids' activities. Natalie led the completion of the slides, facilitated the demo, and assisted with grant applications. Ben applied to various grants and helped with the demo as well.

The agenda covered the Marble Mastermind presentation and FTC grants. By the end of the meeting, the presentation was completed, grants were applied for, and the team relaxed with a game of foosball.

### Looking Ahead

July was a month filled with preparation for workshops, progress on the robot, and securing funding for future projects. As we head into August, we are excited to continue building on these successes.
