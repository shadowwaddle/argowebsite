### May Team Meetings Recap: Hardware, Courses, and New Beginnings

**May has been a month of hardware planning, technical practice, and further development of our WAAW course. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at our activities and accomplishments.**

#### Hardware and Onshape: Meeting 14

On May 5th, our team gathered at 3460 Notre Dame Drive with attendees Seraj, AJ, Ben, Preston, Natalie, Alex, Danielle, Niharika, and Jeeva. The focus of the meeting was on identifying the necessary parts for our hardware projects and practicing Onshape, a critical tool for our design tasks. We also continued work on the WAAW course.

This meeting was notable for AJ's attendance after a hiatus and Seraj joining us for the first time, bringing fresh energy to the team. Our primary tasks included advancing our AI slides and improving our proficiency in Onshape.
