## Argo & WAAW Course 2024

**Introduction:**  
From the beginning of Argo Robotics, our team has aimed to provide support and connect with organizations worldwide to inspire future innovators in STEM, especially in regions where these concepts are less prevalent. Through this journal, we share our collaborative journey with the WAAW Foundation and the meaningful impact we’ve made together.

**About the WAAW Foundation:**  
The WAAW (Working to Advance Science and Technology Education for African Women) Foundation, founded in 2007, empowers African women to become leaders through STEM education and entrepreneurship training. With over 100 scholarships awarded and 20,000 secondary school girls impacted, WAAW’s outreach programs, including STEM camps and hackathons, promote digital literacy and career guidance for young women in Africa.

### Beginnings

Our outreach journey began with diligent research. Team member Preston identified organizations dedicated to STEM education, ultimately reaching out to the WAAW Foundation. On February 19, 2024, we received an enthusiastic response, leading to our first online meeting on February 29. This initial meeting with Israel Toluwani from WAAW marked the start of a productive collaboration. Over the following weeks, we engaged in brainstorming sessions to determine how Argo could support WAAW and its fellows.

### Curriculum Creation

Creating an engaging and accessible online curriculum for the WAAW fellows involved careful consideration of three key factors: **accessibility, content,** and **structure.**

- **Accessibility:**  
  To accommodate the diverse backgrounds and time zones of students across Africa, we chose platforms that would enable asynchronous learning. We utilized a Discord server for community interaction, Canvas for hosting assignments and lectures, and Zoom for live classes every Saturday. This approach allowed students to engage with course materials at their convenience.

- **Content:**  
  We divided our 12-week course into three sections: **Python Coding, Artificial Intelligence,** and **Computer Architecture.** Each section was designed to build upon the last, ensuring that students could apply their newfound skills to real-world applications. For example, we started with Python basics, advancing to AI concepts and culminating in a thorough understanding of computer architecture.

- **Structure:**  
  Each Zoom class began with a review of the previous session followed by a new topic presentation. Classes included a vocabulary sheet and a project assignment, which encouraged practical application of the lessons. For example, students collaborated on projects using Replit, fostering teamwork and community.

### The Actual Class

The course officially began on April 27, 2024. With around 30 WAAW fellows enrolled, we introduced ourselves and outlined the curriculum. Each week involved engaging lectures and projects that enhanced students' understanding of complex topics.

### Course Content With Selected Completed Projects

- Here’s a more detailed description of each section of the curriculum—Python, Artificial Intelligence, and Computer Architecture—along with specifics about what you taught:


#### Python Coding Unit

**Duration:** Weeks 1-4

In this foundational unit, we aimed to equip students with essential programming skills, enabling them to build a strong base in Python coding. Each week focused on different concepts, with a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and collaborative projects.

- **Week 1: Introduction to Python and Variables**  
  - **Topics Covered:** Introduction to programming, Python syntax, data types (strings, integers, floats), and variables.
  - **Activities:** 
    - Students created simple Python scripts that defined variables and printed them.
    - Homework included writing a short program that accepted user input and displayed it back.

- **Week 2: Control Flow and Loops**  
  - **Topics Covered:** Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), loops (`for` and `while`), and the importance of logic in programming.
  - **Activities:**
    - Students developed programs that made decisions based on user input.
    - Project: groups created a text-based game
      - Group 3, with students Deborah Grace, Emmanuella Kyei Yeboah, Favour Agbo, Jubilee, and Munamato Rusere, Rhoda Kimathi worked to create an intricate text-based game.

- **Week 3: Functions and Lists**  
  - **Topics Covered:** Defining functions, understanding scope, and working with lists and list methods.
  - **Activities:**
    - Students wrote functions to perform specific tasks and manipulated lists (e.g., adding/removing items).
    - Project: creating a program that generated a calculator, with interesting and unique functions.
      - Group 1, which included students Ani Uzoamaka Chinedu, Dike Chiamaka Mary, Eddicia Benya, Grace Liz, Oscar-Daniels Precious Nneoma, and Oyindamola Deji-Agboola created a series of functions that acted as a full calculator user experience. With a combination of control flow statements, and user inputs, the calculator worked well and even checked for errors.

- **Week 4: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - **Topics Covered:** Basic principles of OOP, including classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
  - **Activities:**
    - Students designed simple classes and created instances to understand how OOP organizes code.
    - Project: each group designed a bank account system, which allowed for all functions that person may need with a real life bank.
      - Also created by Group 1, this program utilized classes, and within them initializers and methods to create a virtual bank account.
