Welcome to the third and final unit of our 12-week online course, in collaboration with the Waaw Foundation! In this unit, participants journeyed into the heart of computing as we explored the intricacies of computer architecture. Over the course of four weeks, learners delved into the inner workings of CPUs, memory management systems, and other essential components that form the backbone of modern computing. Through engaging lessons, interactive simulations, and hands-on projects, participants gained a deep understanding of how computers function at a fundamental level. By the end of this unit, participants had explored code examples, conducted simulations, and completed projects that provided practical insights into the inner workings of computer hardware.
